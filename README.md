# Legacy Portfolio

This GitHub repository contains my legacy web development portfolio, which I created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. The objective of the certification was to use HTML and plain CSS to build five responsive web pages that fulfill freeCodeCamp's user stories.
This is the fifth.

## Description

The portfolio showcases my web responsive development skills and experience through five web pages, each with a different focus. The pages are designed to be visually appealing, responsive, and easy to navigate.

The portfolio includes the following pages:

-   A homepage with a brief introduction and a call to action for potential employers or clients to contact me.
-   A "About" with a bio, and some informations about my professional background, education, and skills.
-   A "Services" What I do for my Partners?
-   A "Projects" page with links to some of my recent web development projects, including descriptions and screenshots.
-   A "Contact" page with a form for potential employers or clients to contact me directly via calendly.
-   A "Questions" a section to overcome the objections of my future partners and sell my service.

## Features

The legacy portfolio includes several features that demonstrate my web development skills, including:

-   Responsive design that looks great on desktop and mobile devices.
-   Custom CSS styles and layouts to add visual interest and interactivity.
-   Semantic HTML and accessible design to ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.
